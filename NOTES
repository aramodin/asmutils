Current release notes (0.09)
  
 Here are the most noticable things that have happened. There's a number of
 new utils (6), I would like to thank H-Peter Recktenwald and Alexandr Gorlov
 for new utils, and Christopher Li for bugfix in dmesg. Now you can learn
 almost everything about your CPU with cpuinfo and cpuspeed, change your CDs
 with ccd, figure out extention, directory, and tty names with extname and
 dirname and tty respectively :)
     
 Due to internal improvements FreeBSD binaries are smaller, and..
 Yes! httpd now works on FreeBSD, and is less than 1kb !! :)
     
 Documentation was updated, I've created Asmutils-HOWTO instead of old docs,
 which will contain all development- and usage-related information;
 I suggest all developers to read this document.
     
 I'd like to ask and encourage everyone to stress-test this release
 and report bugs. I am going to make 0.10 release marked as "stable",
 and go for "development" release 0.11, which will break a lot of things.
     
 Full list of utils in 0.09 release (total of 58):
     
    arch basename cat ccd chmod chroot chvt cpuinfo cpuspeed deallocvt df
    dirname dmesg domainname echo eject env extname factor false grep halt
    hosname httpd id kill ln ls lsmod lzss md5sum mkdir more mount nc
    poweroff ps pwd rc6crypt reboot rmdir rmdsum rmmod sleep sln softdog
    strings swapoff swapon sync tee true tty umount uname update wc yes
       
 Fully functional utils:

    arch basename dirname echo factor false pwd sleep sync tee true uname yes
       
 Almost fully functional utils:

    chroot dmesg mkdir sln tty wc
       
 Please note that this functionality mainly affects command line options
 support; behavior is not well tested, however it SEEMS to be the same.
 You are especially encouraged to use and test them :)
 Long options like --version and --help are not supported.
