Current release notes (0.06)
  
 Long awaited release is finally here.
     
 A lot of new utils were added, and existing were improved.
 Main contributors for this release are Dmitry Bakhvalov
 and Cecchinel Stephan (thanks, guys!).
     
 Assembly libc is up, and it's already possible to link a simple
 program against it. Plenty of functions are missing, but just the
 fact gives the hope ;) One of the outstanding features of this libc
 (of course except the size and the speed) is that it will be
 possible to use both cdecl and fastcall compiled programs WITHOUT
 libc recompilation, i.e. calling convention will be configured at
 RUNTIME (!). How can it be done?? Well, remember that everything is
 possible with assembly language ;)
     
 Also soon the project will become portable across x86 platform,
 and will run under FreeBSD and other *BSD's, and possibly under BeOS
 (hmm, how about Windows? :). Portability was implemented into the
 asmutils from the beginning, but somewhy is still not brought to
 working stage. This will happen a bit later, possibly in 0.07 -- 0.08.
     
 Full list of utils in 0.06 release (total of 50):

	arch basename cat chmod chroot chvt deallocvt df dmesg domainname
	echo eject factor false grep halt hosname httpd id kill ln ls
	lsmod lzss md5sum mkdir more mount nc poweroff ps pwd rc6crypt
	reboot rmdir rmdsum rmmod sleep softdog strings swapoff swapon
	sync tee true umount uname update wc yes
       
 GNU compliant utils:

	basename, echo, factor, false, pwd, sleep, tee, true, uname, yes
       
 Please note that this compliance mainly affects command line
 options support; behavior is not well tested, however it SEEMS to
 be the same. You are especially encouraged to use and test them :)
 Options --version and --help are not supported.
