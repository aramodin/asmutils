Current release notes (0.08)
  
 There are plenty of different changes. Here are few worth to mention.
     
 I tried to port asmutils to BeOS, but because of confusing and weird
 BeOS kernel bugs asmutils/BeOS do not work yet.
 Read my comments in os_beos.inc for details.
     
 Another cool port was done -- libc port :); i.e. it is possible to fallback on
 libc functions instead of using direct kernel syscalls (by defining OS=LIBC in
 Makefile). This can be useful when running project on OS with unknown/broken
 kernel call conventions (f.e. by means of this asmutils can run on BeOS).
     
 There were several portability improvements: kill and tee now run on FreeBSD.
 httpd was rewritten and now is only 596 bytes on Linux (and almost works on
 FreeBSD, but falls into endless fork loop on the first request, why? :).
 Network syscalls macros added (sys_socket, sys_accept.. etc, instead of Linux
 specific sys_socketcall), so it's possible to write portable network utils now.
     
 Assembly libc now features run-time fastcall support.
     
 There were other various internal improvements, new features, and bugfixes.
     
 Full list of utils in 0.08 release (total of 52):
     
    arch basename cat chmod chroot chvt deallocvt df dmesg domainname echo
    eject env factor false grep halt hosname httpd id kill ln ls lsmod
    lzss md5sum mkdir more mount nc poweroff ps pwd rc6crypt reboot
    rmdir rmdsum rmmod sleep sln softdog strings swapoff swapon sync
    tee true umount uname update wc yes
       
 GNU compliant utils:

    arch basename echo factor false pwd sleep sync tee true uname yes
       
 Almost GNU compliant utils:

    chroot mkdir sln wc
       
 Please note that this compliance mainly affects command line options support;
 behavior is not well tested, however it SEEMS to be the same.
 You are especially encouraged to use and test them :)
 Long options like --version and --help are not supported.
