Current release notes (0.10)
  
 Finally it is here. Fairly stable and fairly innovative.
 Here are the most noticeable things worth to mention:
     
 File management utils were contributed by Dmitry Bakhvalov - cp, mv, rm
 (heh, now you can destroy your data with rm -r /, but do not forget to
 cp -r it somewhere before).
     
 Now we have OpenBSD port, and NetBSD port too (hm.. I start to think
 about BSDI, AIX, HP-UX..).
     
 All include files were extended and updated according to the latest
 kernel versions, source structure was reorganized a bit, top Makefile
 and MCONFIG were added. Framebuffer stuff was merged, and new intro
 has appeared - fire256 (by Paul Furber).
     
 Alpha version of libc finally works with both fastcall and cdecl
 (a great milestone towards success). Also, all crypto algorithms
 are now build into one library - libcrypto.
     
 Asmutils-HOWTO was updated and cleanuped; I suggest all developers
 to read this document.
     
 For full list of changes examine ChangeLog. Hope you'll enjoy this release.
     
 I would like to thank all contributors for helping me to carry out
 this release, and especially:

    * Andrew Gillham for testing NetBSD build and providing NetBSD binaries
    * Tani Hosokawa for bugfixes, OpenBSD port and providing OpenBSD binaries
    * Dmitry Bakhvalov for cp, mv, rm
    * Mooneer Salem for custom httpd 404 error message
       
 Full list of utils in 0.10 release (total of 61):
     
    arch basename cat ccd chmod chroot chvt cp cpuinfo cpuspeed deallocvt df
    dirname dmesg domainname echo eject env extname factor false grep halt
    hostname httpd id kill ln ls lsmod lzss md5sum mkdir more mount mv nc
    poweroff ps pwd rc6crypt reboot rm rmdir rmdsum rmmod sleep sln softdog
    strings swapoff swapon sync tee true tty umount uname update wc yes
       
 Special bonus:

    fire256 leaves window
       
 Fully functional utils:

    arch basename dirname echo factor false pwd sleep sync tee true uname yes
       
 Almost fully functional utils:

    chroot dmesg mkdir sln tty wc
       
 Please note that this functionality mainly affects command line options
 support; behavior is not well tested, however it SEEMS to be the same.
 You are especially encouraged to use and test them :)
 Long options like --version and --help are not supported.
