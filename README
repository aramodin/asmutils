Do I need this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In general case you don't.

This package is great for small distributions (rescue, embedded,
etc). It contains extremely small and fast replacements for several unix
utilities. Usual way for small system is to replace binaries with shell
scripts; however, scripts require much more memory and are slow.
This package provides:

    1) binaries
    2) that do not require libc
    3) are small as scripts
    4) are fast as kernel
    5) need only few KBytes of RAM

Several utilities are fully GNU compliant, examine NOTES for details.

All utilities are quite dirty hacks sometimes, but they work well,
at least on 2.0 and 2.2 kernels.

So, it's better to say in such a way: if you need this, you know it.

Another goal of this package is to provide source code and some kind
of library, and encourage assembly programmers to write for Linux/Unix.
Usually Unix is associated with C, and no one wants to deal with assembly..
Browse the source, look -- it is simple. Read the docs, start to write,
and you will like it :)



How to install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 REQUIREMENTS:

	1) i386 (however some programs may require higher CPU)
	2) ELF support
	3) some programs may require FPU (or kernel emulation)

	Currently project supports Linux and FreeBSD, however
	it is quite portable to any ELF/i386 based OS.

 WARNING: Before using any command first look at its syntax!
	  Some utils can work not as you may expect!

 Syntax of command can be obtained from appropriate source
 from [src] directory, do not expect any answer from program
 on --help or --version switches. Lazy people can just launch
 "syntax" script in [bin] directory.
 
 
 Asmutils include few sets of precompiled binaries, for Linux 2.0/2.2
 and FreeBSD. Rule is simple -- use the one which suits your kernel.

 Installation itself is simple too: take precompiled binaries from
 [bin] directory for your kernel and copy them where you need.


 If you want to compile source you will need:

  - nasm 0.98 or higher
  - ld from GNU binutils 2.9
  - GNU make 3.77 or higher  

  (older/other versions may work too, just these are versions I used)
  
  cd [src], issue make (or gmake) and hopefully all will be done.
  You may also read Asmutils Source Guide (doc/asmutils-source-guide.html)
  if you want to learn some details on compilation (size/speed optimization,
  different kernel versions, etc).
