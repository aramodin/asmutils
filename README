Description
===========

asmutils is a set of different utilities written in assembly language,
targeted on embedded systems and small distributions (like rescue or
installation disks). It features the smallest possible size and memory
requirements, the fastest speed and good functionality.
Currently project supports Linux and FreeBSD (BeOS support is
in the works), however it is quite portable to any i386 OS. 

Another goal of this package is to provide PORTABLE source code library,
and to encourage assembly programmers to write for Linux/UNIX.
Usually UNIX is associated with C, and no one wants to deal with assembly..
Browse the source, look -- it is simple. Read the docs, start to write,
and you will like it; assembly programming is a lot of fun, especially
when you deal with UNIX-like operating systems.

Usual way for small system is to replace binaries with shell scripts;
however scripts require much more memory and are slow.
This package provides:

    1) binaries
    2) that do not require libc
    3) are small as scripts
    4) are fast as kernel
    5) need only few KBytes of RAM

Several utilities are fully compliant with usual, examine NOTES for details.

Anyway, you can try to fallback to libc functions instead of using direct
system calls by defining OS=LIBC in Makefile, if your really want to do so.


How to install
==============

 REQUIREMENTS:

	1) i386 (however some programs may require higher CPU);
	   some programs may require FPU (or kernel emulation)

	2) ELF executable format (actually not a requirement,
	   you just need to write startup stack preparation
	   for your executable format on your own)

 WARNING:
 
 Before using any utility first DO LOOK AT ITS SYNTAX; some utils may work
 not as you expected. Syntax can be obtained from appropriate source from
 src directory (do not expect any answer from program on --help switch).
 
 Asmutils include few sets of precompiled binaries, for Linux 2.0/2.2
 and FreeBSD. Rule is simple -- use the one which suits your kernel.

 Installation itself is simple too: take precompiled binaries from
 [bin] directory for your kernel and copy them where you need.

 If you want to compile source you will need:

  - nasm 0.98
  - ld from GNU binutils 2.9
  - GNU make 3.77
  - possibly something else

 Older/other versions may work too, just these are versions I used.
 Examine Asmutils-HOWTO for details on compilation process, then
 cd [src], edit Makefile, run make and hopefully all will be done.
