; BIG FAT WARNING:
;
; THESE UTILITIES WORK WITH LINUX KERNEL DIRECTLY.

; THEY WORKED ON MY LINUX BOX, BUT THEY CAN CRASH YOURS.
; NO WARRANTY. THIS IS DEVELOPMENT VERSION, USE SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Do I need this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In general case you don't.

This package is great for small Linux distributions (rescue, embedded,
etc). It contains extremely small and fast replacements for several unix
utilities. Usual way for small system is to replace binaries with shell
scripts; however, scripts require much more memory and are slow.
This package provides:

    1) binaries
    2) that do not require libc
    3) are small as scripts
    4) are fast as kernel
    5) need only few KBytes of RAM

Several utilities are fully GNU compliant, examine NOTES for details.

All utilities are quite dirty hacks sometimes, but they work well,
at least on 2.0 and 2.2 kernels.

So, it's better to say in such a way: if you need this, you know it.

Another goal of this package is to provide source code and some kind of
library, and encourage assembly programmers to write for Linux. Usually
Linux is associated with C, and no one wants to deal with assembly..
Browse the source, look -- it is simple. Read the docs, start
to write, and you will like it :)



How to install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 REQUIREMENTS:

	1) i386 (however some programs may require higher CPU)
	2) Linux kernel 2.0/2.2 (may work on 2.1 & 2.3 too)
	3) ELF support in the kernel (usually it is there)
	3) some programs may require FPU (or kernel emulation)

 WARNING: Before using any command first look at its syntax!
	  Some utils can work not as you may expect!

 Syntax of command can be obtained from appropriate source
 from [src] directory, do not expect any answer from program
 on --help or --version switches. Lazy people can just launch
 "syntax" script in [bin] directory.
 
 
 Asmutils include two sets of precompiled binaries, both for
 Linux 2.0 and Linux 2.2.

 Rule is simple:

  - use binaries for Linux 2.0 on Linux 2.0
  - use binaries for Linux 2.2 on Linux 2.2

 Installation itself is simple too: take precompiled binaries from
 [bin] directory for your kernel and copy them where you need.


 If you want to compile source you will need:

  - nasm 0.98 or higher (older may work too, I used 0.98)
    (nasm can be obtained from http://www.cryogen.com/nasm)
  - binutils 2.9 or higher (older may work too, I used 2.9.0.15 and higher)
  
  cd [src], issue make and hopefully all will be done. However some binaries
  can be a bit bigger because precompiled were additionally hacked :)
  You may also read Asmutils Source Guide (doc/asmutils-source-guide.html)
  if you want to learn some details on compilation (size/speed optimization,
  different kernel versions, etc).
