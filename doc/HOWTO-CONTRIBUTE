NOTES FOR CONTRIBUTORS

Several conditions must be met:

First of all your code must do something useful, not just be
written in assembly :). Usual unix utils are preferred, but not
required, i.e. you can also contribute a program of yours, not
just some GNU replacement.

Second, you must use nasm, not gas. Also your code must not use
libc or any other library. The only exception are LGPL'ed libraries
also written in assembly (I do not know any).

And the last: use the force - read the source :-) And docs too.

Make sure you've read asmutils-source-guide.html file, without
it you can fail. I've wrote it especially for you, so please read
it before asking me any source related question. Thank you.


Administrativia
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Last step is checking the latest version of asmutils and look what is
already done. Even if the program you want to contribute is not there,
look at CVS <cvs.linuxassembly.org:/pub/asm/asmutils>,
ChangeLog <http://linuxassembly.org/ChangeLog>
or contact me first, may be somebody is already writing it now.
Follow the same rule if you want to improve existing utils. 

Please do not mail me every version of every program of yours, just tell me
its(their) name(s), and mail me them ALL TOGETHER three or four days before
release date (I'll tell you it). Following this simple rule will save me
from the mess of versions.

PLEASE DO NOT SEND ME PATCHES! ONLY FULL SOURCE. THANKS.

Also, sometimes I will modify your code a bit. Please use that modified
code for next program version.

If you have some utilities written in gas and do not want to or have
no time to rewrite them with these conditions you can contribute them
as they are - I myself will rewrite them.

If you got any additional questions -- refer to the asmutils webpage
or contact asmutils maintainer.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST
